        "In this example, we load the text of the novel and analyze its sentiment using the TextBlob library. We calculate the sentiment polarity score using the sentiment.polarity attribute of the TextBlob object, which ranges from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive). We then determine the sentiment label based on the polarity score: positive for polarity > 0, negative for polarity < 0, and neutral for polarity = 0. Finally, we print both the sentiment polarity score and the sentiment label. You can also use other libraries or techniques for sentiment analysis, such as VaderSentiment or machine learning models trained on sentiment analysis datasets."
